@19:22 Initial scoping... what am I going to do here?
@19:23 Import konilo tools
@19:43 fixing errors related to c89 compat
@19:57 get generate-dictionary to work
@20:07 Losing focus. Signing off
I keep getting distracted. No point in staying here.
Generate-dictionary works, and it produces a file called
forth.dictionary. I'm going to need to add a target
in my build script generator that can produces that.

@18:44 Add generate-dictionary to build
Output: forth.dictionary
Input: dict.data
@18:55 Generate konilo.pali
@19:04 Generate blocks
This will be kind of ugly at the moment, since I'm not
sure how yet how I want include all the blocks in source
control.
@19:16 Generate ilo rom
@19:20 Can it build on OSX?
