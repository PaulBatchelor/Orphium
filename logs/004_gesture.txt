@19:51 Initial GestVM import
attempting to import just the things I need from mnolth.
@19:55 things build except for memops, uses lua
memops does not want to build because I think I added
some lua in there.

As a matter of fact, there's also LIL in there as well,
which shouldn't have built either. But, I realize that
LIL is included in the sndkit distro at the moment. I'll
leave it be for now, but it's going to be dead code in
Orphium.
@19:56 TODO revisit memops
memops I think is all the code responsible for getting
TAL code compiled down to uxn byte code. Right now it
won't compile cuz it relies on the Lua C API.

How hard will it be to remove Lua and get the functionality
we want?

In the long run, it'd be nice to use Konilo to metaprogram
Uxn byte code. Reason for this is it'd integrate better
with Konilo. Also, I think it would allow for more fly-by
one-off gestures. But this might end up being more
trouble than it is worth.

@15:34 Try to get core memops C API to compile
the memops stuff is mostly in C, with helper functions
in LIL and Lua. At the very least, I'm going to try and
get things to compile.
