Finally getting around to implementing this algorithm
I've had rattling around in my head for about a year.
I'm implementing this now because I want to make sure
I get grid support working, and this algorithm is a
primary part of the input method.

The first files here are just going to be a proof of
concept, with a file for the bitrune algorithm, and
an a small example in the test folder.

@12:09 set function

@12:35 initial debugging
@12:47 things work! TODO: bounds checking, better printing
@19:04 bounds checking
@19:17 correction in initial logic
I was initially going to re-use topleft and make an
equivalent bottom right, bit checking the output I realized
that doesn't actually capture the bounding box.

Instead, I will need to find the min/max XY positions of tiles.
