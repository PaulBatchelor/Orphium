Finally getting around to implementing this algorithm
I've had rattling around in my head for about a year.
I'm implementing this now because I want to make sure
I get grid support working, and this algorithm is a
primary part of the input method.

The first files here are just going to be a proof of
concept, with a file for the bitrune algorithm, and
an a small example in the test folder.
